                    <li><blockquote>This was a great class, I learned a lot and the assignments directly affected what we were learning and also gave me pieces to put in my portfolio and keep working on to improve.</blockquote></li>

                    <li><blockquote>I wish there were more classes on front end coding! I learned so much and the knowledge I obtained is applicable for my desired future career.</blockquote></li>

                    <li><blockquote>Although I came in with a little web design experience, this course taught me a lot beyond what I already knew. I truly enjoyed this class and was able to come up with some great personal project ideas. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to pursue a career in web design.</blockquote></li>

                    <li><blockquote>I absolutely love this class! This is probably my favorite class so far! I love how this class values flexibility and creative freedom by letting us choose our topic for each project. This class made me love front-end web development more and I hope to continue on with that path. I learned tons of technical, design and soft skills that are also transferrable. </blockquote></li>

                    <li><blockquote>I took this class as a "fun" elective, not realizing the intensity and challenge of the course. However, I don't regret it one bit because I learned so much and challenged myself to step outside my comfort zone by diving into a more advanced coding class. Overall I enjoyed this class and loved being able to find my way through challenges in this course. </blockquote></li>
